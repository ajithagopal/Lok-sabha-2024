              <p class="first-phara">Congress’s resurgence continued. The United Progressive Alliance returned to power with a stronger mandate. Manmohan Singh was sworn in as the Prime Minister for a second term, the first PM since Indira Gandhi to have full two terms to their credit. The Samajwadi Party emerged as the single largest party in Uttar Pradesh, and the Telangana movement reached a crest with the passing of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act. The tenure was marred by a significant growth slowdown, poor delivery of welfare schemes and a score of corruption scandals that would deplete people’s trust in the ruling party.</p>

                  <h2>The polls</h2>
              <p>India voted in five phases between April 16 and May 13. The Delimitation Commission 2008 had redetermined boundaries, with the delimitation of 499 new constituencies. The Parliamentary Constituencies reserved for Scheduled Castes increased from 79 to 84; those for Scheduled Tribes increased from 41 to 47. This is the first election where Photo-Elector rolls were in use, except Assam, Nagaland and Jammu and Kashmir.</p>

              <p>Both the total number of voters and voter turnout increased in comparison to 2004, the latter standing at 58.19%. The number of female candidates (556) contesting elections grew by more than half in comparison to previous elections. 59 of them were elected to Lok Sabha seats, the maximum coming from Uttar Pradesh.</p>

              <p>The electorate gave a clear mandate to the Indian National Congress. With its 206 seats, the party surpassed 2004’s performance and registered its best performance since 1991 - the last time India saw a single-party, minority government. “The Congress holds all the aces”, <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/india-chooses-congress/article67963788.ece" target="_blank"><i> The Hindu</i> noted in an editorial.</a></p>

              <p>The Bharatiya Janata Party trailed with 116 seats, losing ground in key Hindi-speaking States such as Rajasthan to Congress. The Samajwadi Party registered a promising victory with 23 seats, emerging as the single largest party in Uttar Pradesh.</p>

              <h2 class="mt-3">The house of the people</h2>


              <p>Congress and its allies emerged victorious across the States. The party retained its base in Andhra Pradesh, recovered lost ground in West Bengal, Kerala and Rajasthan, won parts with allies in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. The party also re-emerged as a key player in Uttar Pradesh, where 80 seats were on offer. The party, however, lost Orissa’s Koraput Constituency for the first time since 1957.</p>

              <p>BJP won in Gujarat, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka, but lost ground in the Hindi belt and suffered due to disappointing performances from its allies. This included defeats from Shiv Sena in Maharashtra; the Telugu Desam Party and Telangana Rashtra Samiti in Andhra Pradesh; the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in Tamil Nadu. Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) in Bihar was an exception. In Maharashtra, <i> The Hindu</i> noted that the Raj Thackeray-engineered split in Shiv Sena “played a role” in the merger of Congress and Nationalist Congress Party. A severe fall was seen from the Left Front in West Bengal and Kerala. For the first time in almost three decades, they failed to win majority seats across these regions. </p>

              <p>Manmohan Singh returned as Prime Minister, the first PM since Indira Gandhi to have completed two full terms. <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/manmohan-makes-way/article5584302.ece" target="_blank">Mr. Singh is credited for skillfully steering the coalition government,</a> leading the economy through turbulence, and tactfully handling minority stakes by roping in the Samajwadi Party to compensate for the Left Parties’ exit. Mr. Singh did not contest as prime ministerial candidate for a third term, paving the way for Rahul Gandhi to lead the party. As for his opponent Narendra Modi, <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/interview/history-will-be-kinder-to-me-than-the-media-says-manmohan/article5535346.ece" target="_blank">Mr. Singh in an interview to <i> The Hindu,</i></a> said: “it will be disastrous for the country to have Shri Narendra Modi as the Prime Minister”.</p>

              <p>BJP stalwart Sushma Swaraj was the Leader of the Opposition during UPA-II’s tenure. <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sushma-swaraj-1952-2019/article60645804.ece" target="_blank"> Mrs. Swaraj was a “woman of many firsts”:</a> the first woman Chief Minister of Delhi, the country’s youngest-ever Cabinet Minister and the first woman spokesperson for a national party.</p>

              <p>The nation also saw the first woman Speaker of Lok Sabha in Meira Kumar, the daughter of freedom fighter and former Deputy Prime Minister Jagjivan Ram. Ms. Kumar had worked with the Indian Foreign Service and was known for her work in social justice and women’s issues. She secured UPA’s nomination for a presidential candidate in 2017, pitted against NDA’s Ram Nath Kovind.</p>

              <h2 class="slow-intro-element">The politics</h2>
              <p class="slow-intro-element">Congress had “sown the seeds of its own resurgence by adopting a long-sighted strategy in the two key Hindi-speaking States”, <i> The Hindu’s</i> editorial noted. UPA also overcame the anti-incumbency sentiment and the communal plank on which BJP’s campaigning was built. Factional infighting in Kerala and a strong oppositional alliance in West Bengal stymied Left’s claim to power. In Tamil Nadu, where the Congress fought with ally Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, the Sri Lankan Tamil issue dominated campaign rhetoric.</p>

              <p>Corruption, price rise and an economic lull plagued this tenure; the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party succeeded in creating an anti-Congress mood by highlighting the string of scams, from 2G spectrum to coal allocation.</p>

          <h2>The agenda</h2>

          <p>The parliament was also disrupted frequently, its productivity (61%) being the worst in more than 50 years at the time. The UPA and Opposition parties feuded over the 2G spectrum scam, coal blocks, FDI in retail, Commonwealth Games and Adarsh housing for Congress. Narendra Modi’s alleged favour to the Adani business group and Nitin Gadkari’s collusion with the Purti group were also discussed. A lack of assuring leadership, inability to control prices and charges of corruption drove voter sentiment away from the UPA. By 2013, three in four people believed that the UPA-II was corrupt, and that corruption had increased in this tenure, <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/two-out-of-three-say-upa-is-corrupt/article4945558.ece" target="_blank">a poll showed.</a> </p>

          <p>About 222 Bills were introduced (apart from Finance and Appropriation Bills); 165 passed by the House and 71% of the Bills were referred to Parliamentary Committees for examination. The Andhra Pradesh Re-organisation Bill, which split the State into Telangana, was passed amidst a TV blackout. In an <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/democracy-in-peril/article5719563.ece" target="_blank">editorial dated February 23,</a> <i> The Hindu</i> compared the parliament to “a wrestling arena”.</p>

          <p>Significant laws that were cleared included the Right to Education, Land Acquisition, Food Security, Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bills and the anti-corruption Lokpal Bill. Under Mr. Singh’s government, India concluded several free trade agreements, including with South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, and ASEAN.</p>

          <p>India’s economy also grew faster on average during his time in office than ever before in recorded history despite a hostile international economic environment. Still, rising prices, faltering growth, weakening currency and a burgeoning deficit hampered UPA’s ability to create jobs and manage inflation. Scholars have attributed UPA’s political troubles to “an inability to tackle the consequences of accelerated economic growth”.</p>
