                The fourth Lok Sabha was in session between 1967 and 1970. A sense of disquiet prevailed: two Prime Ministers had died, India had seen war on its borders, economic growth had stalled, and the ruling Congress party was hit by internal factionalism. The Indian National Congress retained power albeit with a reduced majority, and Indira Gandhi was elected the Prime Minister. Her government prioritised the promise of Green Revolution in the face of a looming food insecurity and nationalised commercial banks as inflation and economic despair grew. Rifts within the party became prominent despite Mrs. Gandhi’s central leadership. Coalition governments also officially entered the political landscape.

                <p><a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-emerging-pattern/article67964490.ece" target="_blank"><i>The Hindu </i> in an editorial</a> commented on the turning tide: “Never has a ruling party, so well entrenched in office for two decades...been administered such compelling shocks by a resentful electorate.”</p>

              <h2>The polls</h2>
              <p>Elections were held between February 17 and 21; polling was conducted across 17 States and 10 Union Territories. The number of constituencies increased to 520. The voter turnout was 61.04% (a 5.62% increase from 1962) with a rise in polling stations too. A total of 25 parties - 7 national, 14 state, 4 registered - were in the fray. Uttar Pradesh elected the highest seven female candidates, with a total of 29 female candidates making it to the fourth Lok Sabha. This election also witnessed a more active and direct participation of princes, big businessmen, former ICS officers and retired military officers, a potential first in the Indian electoral scene.</p>
              
              <p>The Indian National Congress secured 56% of the seats of the House (283), followed by Swatantra Party (44) and Bharatiya Jana Sangh (35). For seats reserved for SC and ST categories, INC, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and BJS performed well. The BJS emerged as a party in the northern states, winning 35 seats in total.</p>

              <p>Congress’s setback was evident. It retained the majority with 283 seats, as opposed to 360 seats in 1962. It also lost majority in at least eight States — West Bengal, Odisha, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.</p>

              <p>Who benefited from the increased voter turnout? Not Congress, showed an analysis published in <i>The Hindu </i>dated March 15. Congress held only one in four of additional votes polled; in 1962, it was one in three.</p>

                This was the first General Election where the country would see the first woman elected as the Prime Minister. Congress’s leadership had two possible contenders after the deaths of Pandit Nehru and Lal Bahadur Shastri: Independence activist Morarji Desai and Mr. Nehru’s daughter Indira Gandhi, who was serving as the Information & Broadcasting Minister. Mrs. Gandhi had been in the public gaze for years at this point, routinely seen touring with her father or at events.

              <p>In 1966, Ms. Gandhi contested from her late husband’s constituency, Rae Bareli. In an intra-party ballot, Ms. Gandhi defeated the senior leader 355 votes to 169. This sowed “the seeds for the first of the many internal discontentments that would later hurt the party’s prospects, and the ultimate split that took shape a few years later”, <i><a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ten-elections-that-shaped-india-1967-elections-and-the-rise-of-indira-gandhi/article67606873.ece" target="_blank">The Hindu </i> noted.</a></p>

              <p>After the split in 1969, Congress leader Ram Subhag Singh served as the Opposition leader in the fourth Lok Sabha. N. Sanjiva Reddy was the Speaker of the House at the time. Mr. Reddy, a former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, would later serve as the sixth President of India</p>

              <p class="slow-intro-element">The Indian National Congress retained power albeit with a reduced majority. Coalition governments officially entered the political landscape, as regional parties strived to present an alternative. The Congress, for the first time in 15 years, faced “formidable Opposition”.</p>

              <p>The Congress battled a resentful electorate and a strong Opposition, a distressed economy, food insecurity and charges of corruption. There was “despondency, frustrations, uncertainty and recurrent agitation”.</p>

              <p>The party was riddled by questions of succession. A leadership contest played out between Ms. Gandhi and Mr. Desai. Thaere was further friction in 1969 when Mrs. Gandhi snatched Mr. Desai’s ministerial portfolio. There was a “general feeling that Congressmen in leading positions were more concerned about feathering their own nests rather than attending to the needs of the masses,” <i>The Hindu </i> noted in an article.</p>

              <p>The factionalism and Congress’s conflicting ideologies left the ground fertile for the rise of coalition parties. The Communist party of India (Marxist), Akali Dal and Jan Sangh partnered in Punjab, and in Tamil Nadu, Swatantra Party, CPM, Muslim League and the DMK joined hands. Coalitions began forming, from Bengal to Uttar Pradesh. The Congress decided against joining coalition in any State where it failed to achieve absolute majority, <i> The Hindu </i> reported on February 28.</p>

          <h2>The agenda</h2>

          <p>Congress had its work cut out. The Third Plan for economic growth was an “unmitigated disaster”. The party doubled down on improving agricultural production as famine-like conditions grew. By 1967, there was not enough food to feed almost 480 million people. <i>The Hindu’s </i>editorial remarked: “Unless there is a united and resolute Government at the Centre, which has a clear awareness of its responsibilities...the divisive and subversive forces that have reared their heads in recent years will engulf the country.”</p>

Congress’s friction grew - clashing over ideologies and degree of control. Mrs. Gandhi was expelled in November 1969 by the party’s working committee for “attempting to capture the Party machine by pressurising the rank and file and subjecting them to false and misleading propaganda to make them toe her line”. The split was institutionalised: Mrs. Gandhi formed the rival Indian National Congress (Requisitionists) group. Not wanting to rely on smaller parties for support, Mrs. Gandhi advised that the Parliament be dissolved.</p>
