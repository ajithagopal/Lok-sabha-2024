              <p class="first-phara">The Lok Sabha was in session for 15 months, from December 1989 to March 1991. For the first time since independence, no party had a majority in the Lower House, resulting in the National Front coalition forming the government. Janata Dal’s V.P. Singh was sworn in as the Prime Minister. The session witnessed the early days of the Mandir and Mandal politics, with caste-based reservation protests and Ram Janmabhoomi movement stirring unrest throughout the country. The shadow of the Bofors scandal, Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination and turbulent economic conditions also loomed large on the electorate.</p>

              <h2>The polls</h2>

              <p>Polls were held across 25 States and seven Union Territories - 543 Constituencies - between November 22 and 26, 1989. Vying for these seats were more than 6,000 candidates. A charged communal atmosphere unfolded in the backdrop, after Rajiv Gandhi allowed the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) to perform <i>shilanyas </i> at the disputed site Babri Masjid site. Elections in 18 constituencies were postponed.</p>

              <p>The number of voters increased by 20.58%, and voter turnout dipped by 2.1% in comparison to 1984. Out of the 113 contesting parties, no single party won a majority and there was no clear mandate. Congress saw a sharp and severe defeat, bagging less than half (197) of the total seats it won in the 1984 elections. The Janata Dal trailed with 143 seats, followed by the Bharatiya Janata Party. BJP was the biggest gainer - increasing its tally of MPs from two to 85.</p>

              <p>The National Front (coalition) formed the Central Government, with outside support from the BJP and the Left Front. The coalition was led by the Janata Dal, formed by V.P Singh who in the previous regime had become the face of the Opposition’s anti-corruption campaign. Other parties included Congress (S),Telugu Desam Party (TDP), DMK and Assam Gana Parishad. TDP’s N.T. Rama Rao was made the Chairman.</p>  

             <p>The contenders for the prime ministerial office included Devi Lal (Indian National Lok Dal), Chandra Shekhar (Janata Dal) and V.P. Singh. Mr. Singh was chosen as the leader of the newly formed coalition government. He served as the Prime Minister for less than a year from December 2 to November 10, 1990, but gained a reputation for being a “disruptor” with the implementation of the Mandal Commission report. “V.P. Singh, the author of the OBCfication of Indian politics and public life, never got enough credit...by those who built their political careers around Mandal politics,” <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/the-disruptor-how-vishwanath-pratap-singh-shook-india-review-mandalites-and-their-reluctance-to-invoke-vp-singhs-legacy/article64825681.ece" target="_blank">Nistula Hebbar wrote in <i> The Hindu.</i></a> </p>

              <p class="slow-intro-element">Congress (I) lost national power and political dominance, with notable losses in the northern belt. As course correction, the party focused on <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/1989-election-coalition-politics-india-congress-loss-victory-rajiv-gandhi-vp-singh/article67679186.ece" target="_blank">“appeasing The Hindu sentiment”, <i>The Hindu</i> noted.</a> Rajiv Gandhi’s government green-signaled the opening of the Babri Masjid locks, “apparently to divert attention from the Shah Bano case and placate the Indian middle class”. Mr. Gandhi also kickstarted his campaign from Ayodhya’s district headquarters. Congress still held appeal among southern voters, clocking 39.53% votes out of Tamil Nadu.</p>

          <p>The Lok Sabha tenure witnessed economic instability and communal protests. The stability of the coalition government was threatened when Mr. Singh’s government in August 1990 decided to implement the recommendations of the Mandal Commission. It endorsed reservations for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in government jobs and shaped discourse around affirmative action for marginalised communities. Outrage spread among the middle-class and upper-caste communities, a key voter base for the BJP. Anti-Mandal protests fragmented north Indian voters over caste lines; a student at Delhi University attempted self-immolation in September 1990 to protest Mr. Singh’s policies.</p>

          <p>There was concurrently a religious upheaval over L.K. Advani’s arrest in Bihar for running the divisive Ram Rath Yatra.</p>
